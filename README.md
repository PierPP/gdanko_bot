This is a POE-based IRC bot I've written completely from scratch and is a constant work in progress.

Basic features:
* sqlite backend
* Bot owner can modify the bot's functions on the fly without the bot leaving IRC. If the new functions module has errors it will not be loaded.
* Full user support with encrypted passwords in the sqlite DB.

More details to come...
